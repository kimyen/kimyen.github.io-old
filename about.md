I am curious about the answer to the question: How are computer science concepts and knowledge applied in the software industry? I am excited to explore challenging problems, great ideas, technical practices and architecture designs. I like to evaluate where I am, what I have learned; and figure out where I want to go, and what I want to work on next.

I love Github and super motivated to integrate with Github API, and trying out Github features. When I learned about Github Pages, I immediately spent the next days setting up this site.
