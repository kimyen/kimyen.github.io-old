I am a software engineer. I do all kind of stuff that engineers do, like chasing the cause of a bug like it owns me money. Big money! 

My favorite tea is Jasmine Green Tea. Every day you would see me taking a few trips to the kitchen with a glass tea pot to get hot water for my floral Jasmine tea. 

I'm terrible at answering questions like "How are you?", "How was your weekend?", or "What's up?" The best way to start a conversation with me is asking me about what's on my mind, what problem I am solving, or what I am excited about today. Or even better, give me a puzzle to solve. :)
