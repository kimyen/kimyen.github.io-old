I am so excited to try out this Github Pages with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). 

I used to host my personal site with a hosting service. Even though there are great hosting services out there, I still needed to manage the domain, installed applications, and used not-very-good-designed apps to manage my content. 

This Github Pages is amazing! I got a domain with 'Github' on it! It's right where most of my work are. I can edit my site and publish the changes using terminal!! And I am using Markdown to write my posts. So convenient!

See how many exclamation marks I put there? I'm super excited!
